Road Accident Analysis by Power BI





Overview

Welcome to the Road Accident Analysis project using Microsoft Power BI! This repository provides a comprehensive guide and resources for analyzing road accident data through Power BI. The project covers essential steps such as data cleaning, processing, modeling, and connecting Power BI with a CSV file. The resulting dashboard utilizes Key Performance Indicator (KPI) cards to display insights on Total Casualties, Accident Count, and types of accidents for the current year, previous year, along with Year-to-Date (YTD) and Year-over-Year (YoY) growth calculations using Data Analysis Expressions (DAX).
