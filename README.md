Power BI Dashboard Project
Overview
Welcome to the Power BI Dashboard project! This repository contains a comprehensive guide and resources for creating a Power BI dashboard focused on analyzing and visualizing data related to casualties and accidents. The project includes steps for data cleaning, processing, modeling, and connecting Power BI with a CSV file. The dashboard incorporates Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for Total Casualties, Accident Count, and types of accidents for the current year, previous year, as well as Year-to-Date (YTD) and Year-over-Year (YoY) growth calculations using Data Analysis Expressions (DAX).
